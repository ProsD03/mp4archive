# MP4Archive: Convert any file into an MP4 Video and back!

MP4Archive (read as "_mp for archive_") is a utility written in Python that allows users to convert any file into a playable MP4 video and back again
into the original file. MP4 videos created with MP4Archive show a grid of colored squares that encode the data of the
original data into RGB color.

This serves no pratical use, as storing files this way gives no real advantages, but it might be fun to experiment with,
to create stenography puzzles or to hide files plain in sight.

> The idea for this software came from the YouTube video "Install MS-DOS 6.22 to your brain with one simple video" by
> dataeeto ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=Y2L7_2Wvycc)). They use FFMPEG to create the video, which also
> feature sound. MP4Archive aims to give a better user experience while trying these type of experiments.
